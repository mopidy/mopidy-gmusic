`Mopidy <http://www.mopidy.com/>`_ extension for playing music from
`Google Play Music <https://play.google.com/music/>`_.


Dependencies
============

You must have a Google account, and either:

- have some music uploaded to your Google Play Music library, or

- have a subscription for Google Play Music All Access.


Installation
============

Install the Mopidy-GMusic extension by running::

    pip install mopidy-gmusic


Configuration
=============

Before starting Mopidy, you must add your Google username and password to your
Mopidy configuration file::

    [gmusic]
    username = alice
    password = secret

If you use 2-step verification to access your Google account, which you should,
you must create an application password in your Google account for
Mopidy-GMusic. See Google's docs on `how to make an app password
<https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833>`_ if you're not already
familiar with this.

By default, All Access will be enabled automatically if you subscribe. You may
force enable or disable it by using the all_access option::

    [gmusic]
    all_access = true

By default, the bitrate is set to 160 kbps. You can change this to either 128
or 320 kbps by setting::

    [gmusic]
    bitrate = 320

All Access radios are available as browsable content or playlist. The following
are the default config values::

    [gmusic]
    # Show radio stations in content browser
    radio_stations_in_browse = true
    # Show radio stations as playlists
    radio_stations_as_playlists = false
    # Limit the number of radio stations, unlimited if unset
    radio_stations_count =
    # Limit the number or tracks for each radio station
    radio_tracks_count = 25

Google Play Music requires all clients to provide a device ID. By default,
Mopidy-GMusic will use your system's MAC address as the device ID. As Google
`puts some limits <https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/3139562>`_ on
how many different devices you can associate with an account, you might want to
control what device ID is used. You can set the ``gmusic/deviceid`` config to
e.g. the device ID from your phone where you also use Google Play Music::

    [gmusic]
    deviceid = 0123456789abcdef

The Android device ID is a 16 character long string identifying the Android
device registered for Google Play Music, excluding the ``0x`` prefix. You can
obtain this ID by dialing ``*#*#8255#*#*`` on your phone (see the aid) or using
this `app <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.deviceid>`_
(see the Google Service Framework ID Key).

On iOS the device ID is an UUID with the ``ios:`` prefix included. (TODO:
Include instructions on how to retrieve this.)


Usage
=====

The extension is enabled by default if all dependencies are
available. You can simply browse through your library and search for
tracks, albums, and artists. Google Play Music playlists are imported
as well. You can even add songs from your All Access subscription to
your library. Mopidy will able to play them.
